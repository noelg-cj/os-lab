-Command syntax
-Write simple functions with basic tests, loops, patterns

1)Accept one or more file name as arguments and convert the file  contents, to uppercase, provided they exist in the current directory. 
2)Accept any number of arguments and prints them in the reverse order.
3)Compute the gross salary of an employee according to the following  rules (i) if basic salary is less than 1500 then HRA =10% of the basic  and DA =90% of the basic. (ii) If basic salary is greater than or equal  to 1500 then HRA =Rs.500 and DA=98% of the basic 
4) Find smallest of 3 numbers that are read from keyboard.
5 )Print a number in reverse order.
6) Print all armstrong numbers between two numbers.
7)Print the following pattern upto n rows, for a given n.

2 2 
3 3 3 
4 4 4 4

n n n n n ..
8)Validate password strength. Here are a few assumptions for the  password string.Length should be minimum of 8 characters.Should  contain both small and capital case letters, atleast a digit and an  underscore.If the password doesn’t comply with any of the above  conditions, then the script should report it as a Weak Password.
9) Print the binary and hexadecimal equivalent of a decimal number.
10)Generate all 3 digit numbers that contain only the digits 0, 1, 2, 3. (number does not start with 0)
11)Given a file containing the marks obtained by students for 3 subjects  in an exam. In order to pass, student should score at least 50 marks in  every subject. The file has one record(line) for each student in the  following format: rollnumber subject1 subject2 subject3 
12)Write a script  to print pass/ fail status of each student in the following format:  rollnumber pass/fail.
13)Find the smallest prime number greater than n which is palindromic.
14)Shell program to print the following pattern upto n rows, for a given n.  *
